# Code Refactor

## Challenge

Although HTML and CSS have been around since the 1990s, they evolve with new versions and features like any other technology. As a developer, your role is often to update code to encompass modern standards and features to maintain compatibility and make code easier to maintain. This process is called refactoring.

The example landing page was developed before Semantic HTML elements were introduced in HTML5. Your challenge is to refactor the code using modern Semantic HTML elements, while keeping the exact same layout and content. Note that some CSS elements may need changing, and it's considered good practice to comment on your changes.

After completing the refactor, you should deploy this project as a new repository on your GitHub and then deploy it as a GitHub Page.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- The differences between older HTML styles and modern practices.
- The importance of using Semantic HTML elements for accessibility and maintainability.
- How to commit changes to GitHub and deploy a project using GitHub Pages.

## User Story

As a web developer, I want to refactor a legacy HTML page to use Semantic HTML elements so that the code is more accessible, maintainable, and aligned with modern standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The HTML structure should be updated to use appropriate Semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- The layout and content of the page should remain unchanged.
- Any necessary CSS adjustments should be made to ensure the layout stays consistent.
- Comments should be added to the code to explain the changes made during the refactoring.
- The project should be committed to a new GitHub repository.
- The final version should be deployed as a GitHub Page.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the provided repository or download the starter files.
2. Open the HTML and CSS files in your code editor.
3. Refactor the HTML to replace non-semantic elements (like `<div>`, `<span>`) with appropriate Semantic HTML elements.
4. Adjust the CSS as necessary to maintain the same visual layout.
5. Comment your code to explain the changes you made.
6. Commit your changes to a new GitHub repository.
7. Deploy the refactored page using GitHub Pages.

## Submission

After completing the exercise, provide the link to your GitHub repository and the live GitHub Pages site in your submission.
